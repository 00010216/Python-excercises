# Exercise 1 - Distance Between Two Points

Python program that calculates the distance (in km) between two points in latitude and longitude.  To calculate the distance, uses the haversine formula.

The program should be able to be run from the command line and then print the answer.

Note: Use the [argparse library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to read command line arguments.

# Exercise 2 - X-0 Game

A numpy array of shape (3,3) represents the game of X-0. Each position can be either “X” or “0” and the player that forms 3 in a row (including diagonals) wins. In python you can represent the game with a numpy array and a function that detects the winner.

# Exercise 3 - Intersecting Polygons

Write a program that prints the area of each polygon and with how many other polygons it intersects (use the [shapely library](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html)).
